## MakeChangeProject


## Project Description:
 This code is designed to calculate change and return the correct amount of money using biggest bill denominations to smallest. I really learned the importance of tracking number accuracy through converting data types from this project, as well as chaining variable data through several equations in order to divide up another variable. Thanks for checking it out!
